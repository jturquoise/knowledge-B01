# OPEN SOURCE KNOWLEDGE 
#################################
# !!!!! SIMPLE ABOUT !!!!!  #
# ------------------------- #
# This is a simple Living Document (read. Always changing) for my most up to date information and documenation on various IT topics. I have bots I have created to assist me on creating this documentation so I cannot guarantee that they will be 100% correct. I have not yet managed to create any bots that I can trust are 100% hallucination free, but that could change. For now, just utilize this as a source for potential personal learning in virtual environments.
# ------------------------  #
# !!!!! SIMPLE POINTS !!!!!!  #
# Point 1: As the internet is further filled up by poorly managed AI systems that spew garbage it becomes harder and harder to find sources that you can trust, and as corportization gets more and more entrenched in society, sources that aren't trying to push their own products. 
# Response 1: It is in my own best interest at least, to set up a repository that I can refer to as I am unsure what I can trust. This may be AI generated in part, but through my many attempts (and hypothetically, the attempts of others), I can refine it into something that is a trusted battle tested guide that anyone can contribute to, or even fork. 
# Counterpoint 1: AI is unethical for [x] reason and you shouldn't help accelerate it.
# Response 2: As long as there is financial incentive in technological progress and we live under a capitalist system, it will be done without our consent. Just like with labor unions, there are ways to at least have a stand in the way things are run. Under a human centric system, this would not be an issue as any progress would be done in the name of humanity. Your problem is with Capitalism, not with Technology.  
# !!!!! MANIFESTO (SCOPE OF PROJECT) !!!!!!  #
# As I believe that Linux is the future that we should be striving for; As I believe that Linux is fundamentally more pro consumer; As I believe we should be striving towards more consumer control vs more Corporate control; I know that we need to make it more accessible. I have some personal projects to make that happen, but I want to have the first thing I put out be something like this. The Linux desktop is ready and as Windows plans on turning Computing into a pay-for-life abomination that turns your device into a locked down 24/7 advertising stream, the time to put the knowledge out there in a trusted method (read. I personally use this information so if nothing else it will be updated by me) is now. 
#
# With that being said, I will be starting with Linux and Computing Fundamentals and expand the project based on my own internal needs. I don't anticipate there being any major interest in this although I might show it to people for funsies.
